        Hello! I'm Jose, a software engineer based in Jersey City, NJ. Well-organized person, problem solver, with strong attention to detail.<br>
        I enjoy building things that live on the internet, from websites and applications to anything in between. My goal is to keep learning and become better than I was yesterday. So the products I build are well designed for a better experience for the end-user.
