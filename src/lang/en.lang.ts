        Hello! I'm Jose, a software engineer based in Jersey City, NJ. Well organized person, problem solver, with strong attention to detail.<br>
        My goal is to keep learning and become better than I was yesterday so the products I build are well designed ensuring a great experience for the end user.<br>
        This interest in programming came in at a young age, with the release of the 1st gen iPod touch. Seeing what people were making with it had me hooked. I used my friend google, and started learning C and Objective-C.<br>
        Fast forward, from interest to hobby it grew. Now here in the web, I enjoy building things that live on the internet, from websites and applications, to anything in between.
